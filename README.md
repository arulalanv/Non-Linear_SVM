# Support Vector Machine
Support vector machine are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
# Non-Linear_SVM
Perform binary classification using non-linear SVC with RBF kernel. The target to predict is a XOR of the inputs.
